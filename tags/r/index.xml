Introduction     This project is my attempt to solve the second case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Projects on Coursera that you can be accessed here.
This project will be about understanding how people use smart devices to help with their health and well-being. This knowledge then will be implemented on products of a smart devices company called Bellabeat. This company aims to manufacture smart devices to help women with their overall health and well-being.</description>
