Introduction This project is my attempt to solve the second case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Projects on Coursera that you can be accessed here.
This project will be about understanding how people use smart devices to help with their health and well-being. This knowledge then will be implemented on products of a smart devices company called Bellabeat. This company aims to manufacture smart devices to help women with their overall health and well-being.</description></item><item><title>Cyclistic - Analyzing User Behavior</title><link>https://tfkachmad.github.io/project/cyclistic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 10:54:10 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://tfkachmad.github.io/project/cyclistic/</guid><description>📷 Clique Studio/Unsplash
Introduction This project is my attempt to solve the first case study from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Projects on Coursera that you can access here. I really enjoy working on this project because not the challenge on this project is ranging from the size of the data provided, to the working on how to create a meaningful analysis to solve the main problem itself.</description></item><item><title>Contributors</title><link>https://tfkachmad.github.io/contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tfkachmad.github.io/contributors/</guid><description>Thank you to all the folks who have contributed both technical and creative skills to this project:
